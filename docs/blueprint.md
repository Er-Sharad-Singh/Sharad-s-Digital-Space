- Subtle animations on scroll and hover, such as fade-in effects and scaling on hover, to add a touch of dynamism without overwhelming the user.
- Parallax scrolling effects on the Home and About sections to create depth.
- A subtle background animation, like a gradient shift or particle effect, to add visual interest without being distracting.
